We can just define a condition and perform the given code block until the condition is no longer `True`.

We then have an `elif` statement that adds any even number to the `new_list`, and a final `elif` statement that tests to see if the number is odd, and if it is odd, then it **continue**s to the next element in our for loop's iteration process. \n", "\n", "So, first let's dig into the `continue` statement. `continue` is telling our loop to **skip** any code that comes after it and go straight to the next element in our loop. So, if we are dealing with number `1` in our list of numbers, we will hit our `continue` statement and immediately go to the next element in our for loop (i.e. `2`). Any code that comes after the `continue` will **not** be executed, **but** our for loop does **not** end execution. This contrasts with the `break` statement. Our break statement is only executed when we have met our condition that the `new_list` has reached the number of elements we want it to have. Once the `break` statement is executed, it will end the execution of the `for` loop altogether. All code after the `break` statement will be ignored, similar to our `continue`, but there will be no next step to the iteration. It stops the loop and that's the end.\n", "\n", "So, essentially, we can use `continue` to *skip* operation on elements and code below `continue`.
